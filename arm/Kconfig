		Arm Errata 709718: VDIV or VSQRT instructions might not complete correctly when very short
		ISRs are used
		Affects: Cortex-M4F
		Fault Type: Programmer Category B
		Fault Status: Present in: r0p0, r0p1 Open.
		On Cortex-M4 with FPU, the VDIV and VSQRT instructions take 14 cycles to execute. When
		an interrupt is taken a VDIV or VSQRT instruction is not terminated, and completes its
		execution while the interrupt stacking occurs. If lazy context save of floating point state is
		enabled then the automatic stacking of the floating point context does not occur until a floating
		point instruction is executed inside the interrupt service routine.
		Lazy context save is enabled by default. When it is enabled, the minimum time for the first
		instruction in the interrupt service routine to start executing is 12 cycles. In certain timing
		conditions, and if there is only one or two instructions inside the interrupt service routine, then
		the VDIV or VSQRT instruction might not write its result to the register bank or to the FPSCR.
		Workaround: A workaround is only required if the floating point unit is present and enabled. A workaround is
		not required if the memory system inserts one or more wait states to every stack transaction.
		There are two workarounds:
		1) Disable lazy context save of floating point state by clearing LSPEN to 0 (bit 30 of the
		FPCCR at address 0xE000EF34).

		2) Ensure that every interrupt service routine contains more than 2 instructions in addition to
		the exception return instruction.
